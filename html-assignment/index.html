            <!--About Me Paragraph 1 -->
            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Alexander Urbach. I'm 18 years old and my birthday is on the 27<sup>th</sup> of September (one week from now). I have a few hobbies like skateboarding, snowboarding and sewing/fashion design. When I want to achieve something in any of my hobbies (such as learning a trick or creating a new garment) I tend to put a lot of time and energy into the process to achieve it as perfect as possible. Another thing I enjoy doing is casual reading. One of my favorite books is titled "The Alchemist".</p> 

            <p>Here's a good quote from the book:</p>
                <blockquote>And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</blockquote>-<cite>Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist</cite> 

            <!-- About Me Paragraph 2 -->
            <p>Another thing I'm passionate about would be creating music. I've been playing guitar for around 7 years and producing music on <abbr title="FruityLoops Studio">FL Studio</abbr> for around 3-5 years. I don't focus on any specific genre and I tend to spend hours in my room experimenting with different sounds. When it comes to my style, I tend to prefer more airy and ethereal sounding melodies.</p>

            <!-- Extra Paragraph -->
            <p>I like web design and I've done work and made sales on Shopify in the E-Commerce field for a few months. I think this class is one of my <strong>favourites</strong> due to the fact that it involves a <em>little less</em> abstract work than the others but I still have the opportunity to be creative when writing code.</p>
